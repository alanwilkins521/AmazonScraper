<h1>
  Amazon Product Page Scraping tool using Python and Beautiful Soup
</h1>
<p>
  This is one of my first data analytics projects using Python. While I have experience in analytics, I don't have any in data mining, so I will use Beautiful Soup to create a basic scraper to pull usefull information from a selection of Amazon product pages into a csv file for analysis.
